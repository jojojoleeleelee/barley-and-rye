Now, list of things I need to do -
1. OMNIAUTH
2. Edit page
3. Fix my recipe page - url is messed up and inhibiting :id of recipe
4. recipes and ingredients need to be related
5. scope methods
6. refractor and clean up code
7. partials and forms?
8. search button!!... maybe not. feeling rather exhausted grappling the complexity of all these nested routes. Ugh. Ingredients used to be so nice and simple... Now it's terribly complicated.
****9. nested routes. Oh dear.
