# Gastronome

## Description

What's in your pantry? Want to utilize even the obscurest of your ingredients to make something delicious? Well then, Gastronome is here for you!

## Background

We all love food. I sincerely don't know anyone who doesn't like food. But wait, does everyone love cooking food? I know, I know. Sometimes it's a pain in the butt trying to come up with something somewhat palatable for dinner. Hence, this app! I've always wanted to create something that could actually help me in the kitchen. With Gastronome, you can log all the grocery items you've bought and add these items in your pantry. With Gastronome, you can keep track of what is going old - nobody wants to see that moldy potato - or what your favorite ingredient is to cook with. Last but definitely not least, it'll give you a wonderful choice of recipes with the ingredients you'd like to showcase ;)

## Features
